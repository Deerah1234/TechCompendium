## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

-   `Vite`
-   `React.js`
-   `TailwindCss`

## üöÄ How can it be improved?

I initiated the project by bootstrapping a Vite app. Following that, I installed Tailwind CSS.

The first rendering involved creating a welcome page, designed to be displayed only once. This was achieved by saving a key in the local storage. The welcome page includes a button that, when clicked, directs users to the quiz component.

Within the quiz component, I implemented the rendering of a timer, quiz questions, and options. The data for these components is sourced from a quizData object. Utilizing the map function, I dynamically generated the options. The quiz component also includes navigation buttons for both previous and next questions.

Subsequently, I created the completion component. This component displays the user's score, highlights the correct answers, and provides options to share the results on Twitter, reset the quiz, and offer feedback.

## üå± How can it be improved?

-   Implement a feature to display the time spent on the quiz.
-   Enhance user experience by adding more themes such as dark mode, light mode, and additional options.
-   Refine the overall user interface for a more polished and intuitive design.
